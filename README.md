In the next few years I plan to be highly proficient with React and other frameworks, so I used a full stack React framework called Next.JS to create this Blue Rabbit Code Challenge since it has been my most recently used framework.

I created the API endpoints to send GET and POST requests to the MongoDB database.

The challenges I came across during this project was implementing the local image file uploader. I decided to go with letting the user upload an image using an image URL instead due to the time, but I am definitely interested in implementing it on my own time to learn more about it.

## API ENDPOINTS
https://bluerabbitchallenge.netlify.app//api/hello is an api endpoint which introduces my name, returning {"message":"Hello, my name is Rayvin Amador"}.

https://bluerabbitchallenge.netlify.app/api/people - API Endpoint with all names and images.
